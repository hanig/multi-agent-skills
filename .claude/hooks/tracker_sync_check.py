"""PostToolUse hook: after an outward action, report unsynced tracker state.

Written because prose did not work. The obligation was documented in
hanig-project SKILL.md step 6 and then skipped twice within the hour by the
session that wrote it. The harness runs this; the model cannot forget it.

What it guarantees, exactly: it detects supported spellings of an outward
command and delivers context about pending or unavailable tracker state. It
does not prove exhaustive detection, it does not make the tracker update
happen, and a reminder the model can read and ignore is a softer thing than
an enforcement. An earlier header here claimed the harness made forgetting
impossible; that was false in two separate ways at once.

## Why this is Python and not the shell script it replaces

The shell version shipped eight defects in two days and seven were found by
review, not by its author:

  1. `eval` on $HANIG_TRACKER_REPO. `'$(rm -rf "$HOME")'` would have run.
  2. The same value interpolated into an ssh remote command string, so
     `"'; touch /tmp/canary; #"` escaped the quoting. This was (1)'s sibling,
     left behind when (1) was fixed.
  3. A state directory derived from the local home and sent to a host where
     that path does not exist, so the probe reported "could not read".
  4. The reminder printed to stdout at exit 0, which the harness shows only
     in transcript mode -- so nothing it produced ever reached the model.
  5. Detection too precise, missing real spellings.
  6. The hook path unquoted in settings.json, so a project directory with a
     space in it silently never ran the hook.
  7. `set -u` plus a bare $HOME: with HOME unset the script died before any
     output, with three silent `exit 0` paths as its siblings.
  8. The probe was reaped by killing the subshell, which leaves the python
     grandchild alive holding the output pipe.

(1), (2), (6), (7) and (8) are substrate defects, not logic defects. A
step-back committee (astra, deepseek-v4-pro) was convened after (7) and both
members independently recommended this port, as a bounded migration with the
behaviour held fixed by tests/test_tracker_sync_hook.py -- which executes
whatever command settings.json wires, so it did not have to be repointed to
let this change pass.

Two rules this file must keep:

  * Configuration is data, never code. No shell strings are assembled here;
    the probe is argv, and nothing derived from the environment is executed.
  * Once a command matches, this hook is COMMITTED to emitting. Every
    failure below degrades to a reported unknown and never to silence,
    because the conditions that would silence it are exactly the ones during
    which the tracker is most likely adrift.
